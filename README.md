# Introduction
This repository contains material for teaching CodeQL.  The presentations are
split by the programming language they present, currently c++,  csharp,  go,  java
and javascript.

# Contributing
Depending on the contribution, use a single file or a directory.
- Single-file presentations are in their language's directory, e.g., 
  `java/workshop-java-mismatched-loop-condition.md`
- Multi-file presentations use whole directories, e.g., `c++/introduction/` houses
  `codeql-workshop-for-cpp.md` and several subdirectories.

While this repository is private, new content can be pushed directly to master.
Minor fixes (typos, broken urls, grammar, etc.) likewise don't benefit from a pull
request and can be pushed directly.  Significant changes should use a pull
request.
